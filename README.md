## üìñ Introduction

The **8 Weeks SQL Challenge** is a fantastic series of SQL case studies created by [Danny Ma](https://twitter.com/datawithdanny). Each case study is based on realistic scenarios where SQL is used to answer business questions, perform data analysis, and uncover actionable insights.

This repository contains my step-by-step solutions to all the case studies in the challenge. Each solution includes:
- SQL queries
- Explanations for the logic
- Visualizations (where applicable)
